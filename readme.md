# Profile Card Component

## This This project is from Frontend Mentor

## Overview

This project implements a Profile Card component designed for showcasing user information, including their name, age, location, and social media insights. It utilizes modern HTML and CSS techniques, including custom fonts and background styling to create an aesthetically pleasing layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the component, including:
  - `@font-face` for custom typography.
  - Flexbox and Grid layout techniques for responsive design.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the profile card.
- `styles/style.css`: Contains all CSS styles applied to the profile card, including typography and layout.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The profile card adjusts for different screen sizes to ensure a consistent appearance across devices.
- **Custom Fonts**: Utilizes the 'Kumbh Sans' font for improved readability and aesthetic appeal.
- **Background Circles**: Includes decorative background elements positioned to enhance the overall design while maintaining focus on the profile information.

## Development Challenges

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered, particularly with positioning the background circles. The goal was to place two Quad-circles that serve as the backdrop for the profile section, ensuring that only half of each circle is visible. Key challenges included:

- **Correct Circle Positioning**: Achieving the desired "quad circle" effect required careful manipulation of CSS properties.
- **Visibility Issues**: Ensuring that the circles displayed correctly across different devices and browser sizes, particularly in mobile views.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of modern CSS practices and provides a visually appealing layout for presenting user profiles. Despite the challenges faced with circle positioning, the project served as a valuable learning experience in CSS layout management.
